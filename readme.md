# Navy Build

`nbuild` is a library providing the following capabilities:

 - Describe a software project from artifacts (source or binary redistributables) to artifacts (usually programs as `.exe` files)
 - Using these descriptions of the project test and report the following:
    - Correctness
    - Completeness
 - Finally using the software project description and the tests, produce a formal documentation
   describing how to use each tested capability.

This directory holds the `nbuild/` source directory as well as an `examples/` directory showing
how one might use `nbuild` to generate reports about projects.
